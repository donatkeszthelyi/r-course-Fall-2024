# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
# Reading the data
cocktail_data <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

print(cocktail_data)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#Cleaning the data, creating separate rows for the ingredients and removing quantities and alcohol content indicators
cocktail_clean <- cocktail_data |>
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>|<br/>|<b") |>
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\d+\\s*[^a-zA-Z\\s]*\\s*|\\d+\\.\\d+%\\s*abv|\\b(oz|dashes|parts|cl|ml|abv|drops|dash|drop|bsp)\\b|\\(.*?\\)")) |>
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

print(cocktail_clean)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
#Creating a dataframe for all the ingredients in alphabetical order
all_ingredients <- cocktail_clean |>
  select(ingredients) |>
  arrange(tolower(ingredients))

#Creating a dataframe, which includes each ingredient only once
unique_ingredients <- all_ingredients |>
  distinct()

print(unique_ingredients)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
#Counting the number of unique ingredients
unique_ingredients_count <- unique_ingredients |>
  nrow()

print(unique_ingredients_count)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
#Dataframe for the frequencies of all the ingredients in descending order
ingredient_frequencies <- cocktail_clean |>
  count(ingredients) |>
  arrange(desc(n))

#Dataframe for the top 10 distinct frequencies
top_10_frequencies <- ingredient_frequencies |>
  distinct(n) |>
  slice_head(n = 10) |>
  pull(n)

#Dataframe for all the ingredients that have a frequency, which is included in the top 10 frequencies
top_ingredients <- sorted_ingredients |>
  filter(n %in% top_10_frequencies) |>
  arrange(desc(n), ingredients) |>
  rename(frequency = n, ingredient = ingredients)

print(top_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
#Dataframe for the cocktails with the most ingredients
cocktails_with_most_ingredients <- cocktail_clean |>
  count(name) |>
  filter(n == max(n)) |>
  rename(ingredient_counts = n)

print(cocktails_with_most_ingredients)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
#Dataframe for the rare ingredients
rare_ingredients <- ingredient_counts |>
  filter(n == 1)
  
#Counting the number of rare ingredients
rare_ingredient_count <- rare_ingredients |>
  nrow()

print(rare_ingredient_count)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
#Listing the rare ingredients' names
rare_ingredients_list <- rare_ingredients$ingredients

#Dataframe for the cocktails that have a rare ingredient
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- cocktail_clean |>
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients_list) |>
  select(name) |>
  distinct()

print(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
#Dataframe for the cocktails without rare ingredients
cocktails_without_rare_ingredients <- cocktail_clean |>
  filter(!name %in% cocktails_with_rare_ingredients$name) |>
  select(name) |>
  distinct()

print(cocktails_without_rare_ingredients)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
#Creating lists for the names of the rows (cocktails) and for the names of the columns (ingredients)
cocktail_names <- unique(cocktail_data$name)
ingredient_names <- unique(all_ingredients$ingredients)

#Creating the empty matrix, with the appropriate rows and columns
cocktail_cheat_sheet <- matrix("", nrow = length(cocktail_names), ncol = length(ingredient_names), 
                                     dimnames = list(cocktail_names, ingredient_names))

#Filling the matrix with 'X'-s in the appropriate places
for (cocktail in cocktail_names) {
  for (ingredient in ingredient_names) {
    if (ingredient %in% cocktail_clean$ingredients[cocktail_clean$name == cocktail]) {
      cocktail_cheat_sheet[cocktail, ingredient] <- "X"
    }
  }
}

print(cocktail_cheat_sheet)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
